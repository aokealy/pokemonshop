Ecommerce Business Model:
========
- E-commerce marketing strategies involve promotional tactics to drive traffic to an online store. A well-thought-out marketing plan, coupled with an engaging website, can convert visitors into paying customers, help businesses retain them and increase their overall customer lifetime value (CLV). If marketing teams stay up to date on the latest trends, they can help the organization reach and retain new customers.

These 10 e-commerce marketing strategies can help set an organization apart from its competition, strengthen the brand, attract new customers and increase sales over time.

1. Search engine optimization
Launching a website is a win for any e-commerce company, but websites aren't enough for consumers to easily find the brand. To improve visibility, marketing teams must optimize websites for search engines. Positive search engine optimization (SEO) requires marketing teams to continually update websites with rich and relevant content that provides useful information for customers.

An SEO strategy can help organizations ensure their content shows up on search engine results pages (SERPs) for relevant queries and deliver positive CX when customers find the information they need. Marketing teams should use SEO keywords and phrases organically within content to alert search engines to the site's relevance for those queries.

Marketing teams should also use easy-to-read URLs and descriptive page names that contain a primary keyword. These URLs and names can also include familiar words or phrases that customers likely use as they search. This strategy requires keyword research to identify opportunities for new content.

2. Content marketing
To support SEO and build brand authority, marketing teams should embrace content marketing in their e-commerce marketing strategies.

For example, a blog can help build a successful marketing strategy and enable brands to produce relevant content about their products. Blogs let marketing teams target important keywords that might not fit naturally on product or category pages. This content can speak directly to consumer needs, offer helpful solutions, build trust and strengthen relationships. Overall, blogs can lead to increased brand visibility and higher conversion rates from new and existing customers.

Content marketing helps answer customers' questions, educate them, deliver the company narrative and lead people to make a purchase. Additionally, different content types, like video, downloadable guides and user-generated content, can strengthen a brand's reputation. This content can also feed the blog and bring more eyes to the organization and its offerings.

3. Social media marketing
In addition to strong SEO that helps content show up on SERPs, brands should meet consumers where they are: on social media. These channels can help engage an active audience.

Billions of people use social media each month, and social media can help brands create authentic connections with their followers. On social media platforms, marketing teams can also respond to comments, publish relevant content and provide more information about their company's products.

Marketing teams should select the right platforms to manage and distribute this content. For example, people on Twitter want to see different content than people on Instagram. Marketing teams should know which platforms the customer base is most likely to use and align the channel they use with them.




TECHNOLOGIES:
=============
The following languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools were used to construct this project. 
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript/ajax
* Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) : This project uses Bootstrap to simplify the development of the webpage
* Python 
* Django
* Sqlite3
* Heroku
* stripe 
* Postgres 

Frameworks:
=============
Bootstrap
==========

This is a front-end framework which is built using HTML and CSS. It makes it easy to create responsive websites using a grid system with screen-width breakpoints.
The homepage 'Most Popular' and 'New Products' functionality is partially provided by the Bootstrap Carousel feature.
Badges are used to provide the item count above the basket; they are also used to detail the status of each individual item status on the Order History page.

JQuery
==========

This is a JavaScript framework which enables easy manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) using JQuery syntax.
This was used to provide the interactive functionality for the homepage carousels. I customised some JavaScript code I found on the internet (see credits) in order to have multiple carousels on one page.

Font Awesome
==========

This is a font library which I have used to provide some context appropriate icons throughout the application. For example, the Basket icon.

Django
==========

This is a high-level python framework which provides advanced functionality with minimal effort from the developer.
The application is developed using Django and extensively uses built-in functionality and custom packages.
